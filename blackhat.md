## 1. Abstract

Smart houses now embed dozens of IoT endpoints — cameras, door locks, environmental sensors, hubs, and assistants — that expand the attack surface without enterprise tooling. A Security Operations Center costs $500K–$2M per year, commercial appliances start near $2,000 plus licensing, and households that suffer a breach face immediate privacy and physical-security loss. The sensor and IoT layer of the home remains largely unmonitored: physical tampering of edge boxes, compromised microcontrollers, and rogue wireless clients fall outside conventional IDS visibility.

This paper presents **ULTRON**, a self-contained autonomous IoT cybersecurity ecosystem **for the smart house**, built on three Raspberry Pi nodes and two ESP32 microcontrollers at approximately **$290** total hardware cost, with **zero cloud dependency**. ULTRON partitions work across three pillars on dedicated hardware: **detection** (Pi3a), **governance** (Pi4 risk scoring and premium dashboard), and **alert management** (Pi3b). Phase 1 — the scope of this paper and of the Black Hat Asia 2027 IoT Arsenal demo — implements continuous detection via a **lean sensor set** (Suricata IDS, passive LAN new-device watch, passive WiFi monitor, GPIO tripwires), a weighted 0–100 risk score with four governance bands, and operator-grade alerting (WebSocket dashboard &lt;100ms, SMTP, LED/OLED). Honeypots and active vulnerability scanners are **deliberately excluded**: they fail the resource-and-use-case test for a home/office guard box behind NAT. Automated response and automated threat analysis/hunting are explicitly deferred to future phases. The system runs fully offline in a single **ULTRON** operating mode suitable for unattended deployment in homes, apartments, and small premises.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Motivation

Managed detection products assume budget and staff that households and small premises do not have. Meanwhile:

- Smart-home IoT and embedded devices expand the attack surface without agent-based EDR coverage.
- Alert fatigue destroys the value of tools that only *notify* without *prioritization*.
- Cloud SIEMs create data-residency, cost, and connectivity dependencies unsuitable for isolated or air-gapped homes.
- Many DIY stacks copy enterprise patterns (honeypots, continuous scanners) that burn RAM/CPU without matching the threat model of a house behind NAT.

### 2.2 Related Tooling Gap

| Approach | Limitation for small / IoT sites |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| Cloud SIEM | Recurring cost, egress, connectivity |
| Enterprise appliance | $2K+ plus licenses; overkill |
| Single-box IDS | No physical sensors, weak prioritization, no unified operator view |
| DIY script pile | No governance model, no evidence chain, no demo-grade UX; often ships honeypot/scanner bloat |

ULTRON fills the gap with **commodity hardware**, **one message bus**, and a **score that turns events into decisions** — and by **refusing services that do not earn their place** on a lean guard box.

### 2.3 Contributions (Phase 1)

1. **Lean detection mesh** — network IDS, passive LAN new-device watch, passive WiFi, and physical tripwires on a shared MQTT contract.  
2. **Risk governance** — weighted fusion, decay, hysteresis, and four bands with **notify-only** escalation.  
3. **Zero-cloud physical feedback loop** — premium dashboard plus ESP32 LED/OLED so posture is visible without a cloud console.

### 2.4 Design Goals

| Goal | Measure |
|------|---------|
| Affordable | ≤ ~$290 BOM |
| Autonomous | 24/7 without cloud |
| Governed | Deterministic 0–100 score + bands |
| Operable | Dashboard event→pixel ≤100ms |
| Lean | No honeypot; no active scanner; every service justified |
| Honest scope | Phase 1 = detect/govern/alert only |

---

## 3. Design Philosophy

### 3.1 Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Zero cloud | No CDN, SaaS, or phone-home |
| One node, one pillar | Governance / detection / alert never blur |
| Notify-first | Humans act in Phase 1; machines score and escalate |
| Evidence always | SQLite + Markdown on **Pi4 USB3 pendrive**; SSD = admin-key + SD offload |
| Fail-visible | DEGRADED banners; never silent failure |
| Cost guardrail | New hardware needs operator approval |
| **Earn your process** | A service stays only with a strong home/office use case and low RAM/CPU |

### 3.2 Pillars

```
DETECTION ──────────► GOVERNANCE ──────────► ALERT MANAGEMENT
 (Pi3a)               (Pi4 + Dashboard + C3)    (Pi3b)
```

### 3.3 Operating Mode

**Single mode: ULTRON.** Continuous autonomous detection and governance. No alternate training, game, or mode-switch command in this release.

### 3.4 Principles of escalation

Alert-driven, human response in Phase 1. Band crossings page the operator; they do not reconfigure firewalls until Phase 2.

---

## 4. Hardware Design

### 4.1 Bill of Materials (~$290)

| Qty | Item | ~$ | Pillar |
|-----|------|----|--------|
| 1 | Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB | 75 | Governance |
| 2 | Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ 1GB | 60 | Detection + Alert |
| 1 | ESP32-C3 SuperMini | 5 | Indicator (LED/OLED) |
| 1 | ESP32-WROOM-32 devkit | 6 | Tripwire |
| 2 | USB WiFi (TL-WN722N, AC600) | 25 | Passive mon + mgmt AP |
| 1 | 5-port Gigabit switch | 20 | Production LAN |
| 3 | PSUs + cables | 35 | Power |
| 1 | SSD 240–500GB (admin-key OS + SD offload) | 40 | Admin key |
| 1 | Pendrive (evidence on Pi4 USB3) | 10 | Evidence |
| — | Cases, jumpers, misc | 14 | Support |
| | **Total** | **~$290** | |

**Power:** ≈38W total. Commodity Raspberry Pi + ESP32 boards only.

### 4.2 Form factor

Smart-house desktop/shelf stack: three boards next to the home router and switch, shared power strip, optional utility-closet mount. ESP32-C3 piggybacks USB to Pi4 (indicator in the hallway); ESP32-WROOM wires GPIO into detection/alert enclosures for physical tamper sensing.

### 4.3 Sensor attachments

| Attachment | Node | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| WS2812B ×8 + SSD1306 | via ESP32-C3 (Pi4 USB2) | Band + score visible in room |
| Case reed/switch ×2 | ESP32-WROOM | Tamper on Pi3a / Pi3b |
| TL-WN722N | Pi3a USB | Passive WiFi monitor |
| AC600 | Pi4 USB3 | Management AP |
| SSD (portable) | laptop / Pi dock | Bootable admin OS → dashboard as admin; scripts offload Pi SD → SSD |
| Pendrive | Pi4 USB3 | Evidence SQLite + reports vault |

### 4.4 Services deliberately excluded

| Excluded | Why it failed the lean test |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| Cowrie / SSH honeypot | Behind home NAT, scanners never reach it; multi-process Python for theater |
| Web lure / decoy login | Same exposure problem; no internet-facing surface |
| Canary files + auditd | Local-only trip; GPIO case reed already covers physical access cheaper |
| nmap / Nuclei / Lynis cadence | Active audit tools, not continuous guard; CPU spikes + noise on Pi3/Pi4 |
| Behavioral "scan burst" weight | Derived from scanners that no longer exist |

**Replacement:** passive **LAN watch** (§9) — unknown MAC joins the house network → instant low-cost signal.

## 6. Node Roles

### 6.1 Pi4 — Governance

**Hardware:** Pi 4 8GB · **IP:** 192.168.100.1  

**Role:** Central governance: MQTT broker, risk engine, **premium dashboard**, health supervision, evidence store (**pendrive USB3**), management AP (AC600), SSD admin-key/offload scripts.

| Service | Function | Port |
|---------|----------|------|
| Mosquitto | MQTT broker | 1883, 9001 WS |
| Risk Engine | Score + band | MQTT sub |
| Dashboard | Single-file operator UI | 8080 |
| Health Supervisor | Service liveness restarts | MQTT health |
| Evidence | SQLite + report index | pendrive (USB3) |
| SSD offload | SD-clean scripts + admin OS | portable |
| hostapd | `SENTINEL-SECURE` AP on AC600 | WiFi |
| dnsmasq | DHCP/DNS for mgmt | 67/53 |

**Boot:** network → mosquitto → risk → dashboard → health → hostapd → ESP32 serial → ULTRON mode.

### 6.2 Pi3a — Detection

**Hardware:** Pi 3B+ 1GB · **IP:** 192.168.100.2  

**Role:** All primary sensors — network IDS, passive LAN watch, passive wireless, tripwire sense.

| Service | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Suricata | IDS signatures on span/mirror (IDS only) |
| sentinel-lan | Passive DHCP/ARP new-device watch |
| Aggregator | Normalize → `ultron/suricata/#` |
| TL-WN722N | Passive monitor only |
| GPIO listener | `ultron/tripwire/pi3a` |

### 6.3 Pi3b — Alert

**Hardware:** Pi 3B+ 1GB · **IP:** 192.168.100.3  

**Role:** Alert delivery (reports synced to Pi4 pendrive vault).

| Service | Function | Port |
|---------|----------|------|
| Alert Manager | Persist + SMTP on RED/PURPLE | MQTT sub |
| Report generator | Daily Markdown → Pi4 pendrive vault | cron |
| GPIO listener | `ultron/tripwire/pi3b` | — |

---

## 7. Network Topology

### 7.1 Dual-network design

| Network | Purpose | Subnet | Path |
|---------|---------|--------|------|
| Production (wired) | Smart-home hosts/IoT under watch, MQTT, dashboard | 192.168.100.0/24 | switch |
| Management (WiFi) | Operator laptop → dashboard only | 192.168.50.0/24 | Pi4 AC600 (USB3) |

### 7.2 Addressing

| Host | IP |
|------|-----|
| Pi4 Governance | .1 |
| Pi3a Detection | .2 |
| Pi3b Alert | .3 |
| Monitored hosts | .10+ |
| Mgmt clients | 192.168.50.0/24 |

Firewall: deny-by-default; mgmt plane may reach **only** `192.168.100.1:8080` (plus SSH as configured).

---

## 8. Risk Scoring Engine

### 8.1 Components & weights

| Component | Weight | Source topic |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Suricata | 0.40 | `ultron/suricata/#` |
| Tripwire | 0.30 | `ultron/tripwire/#` |
| Passive WiFi | 0.20 | `ultron/wifi/#` |
| New device (LAN watch) | 0.10 | `ultron/lan/#` |

Weights sum to 1.00. No scanner-derived or deception-derived components.

### 8.2 Algorithm

```
score = clamp(0, 100, Σ active_component_scores)
every 10s: score = max(0, score - 2)   # decay
band = map(score) with +2 hysteresis at boundaries
publish retained: ultron/risk/score, ultron/risk/band
```

### 8.3 Bands (Phase 1 actions)

| Band | Range | LED | Phase 1 action |
|------|-------|-----|----------------|
| GREEN | 0–29 | solid | monitor |
| YELLOW | 30–59 | chase | dashboard attention |
| RED | 60–84 | strobe | **email** + alarm UI |
| PURPLE | 85–100 | pulse | escalate to operator |

### 8.4 Why scores matter

A raw alert list does not prioritize. The score is the **governance product**: one number the dashboard, LED, and email policy all share.

### 8.5 Alert generation policy

| Trigger | Alert? | Channel |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Band → YELLOW | soft | dashboard |
| Band → RED/PURPLE | hard | dashboard + SMTP |
| Single low-sev IDS | optional | feed only |
| Tripwire edge | hard | feed + risk bump |
| Unknown LAN device | soft | feed + small risk bump |

---

## 9. Passive LAN Watch

**Service:** `sentinel-lan` on Pi3a. **Passive only** — snoops DHCP/ARP (or span copies); never sends probes.

| Signal | Payload | Risk use |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Unknown MAC joins | `ultron/lan/join` | weight 0.10; yellow feed row |
| Device goes silent &gt;24h then returns | `ultron/lan/return` | informational |
| Known-device inventory | SQLite `lan_devices` | daily report |

**Why this and not nmap:** a house guard needs *who joined*, not a full port/CVE sweep every 15 minutes. ARP/DHCP watch is ~0 CPU and still answers the #1 home-ops question: *is that a new device on my network?*

Manual deep scan from dashboard remains an **operator-triggered** Phase 2+ idea — not autonomous Phase 1 behavior.

---

## 10. Wireless Monitoring & IDS

### 10.1 Passive monitoring (Phase 1)

TL-WN722N on Pi3a in **monitor mode only**: rogue/unauthorized AP detection, beacon anomalies → `ultron/wifi/#`.  

**Active wireless attacks are out of scope for Phase 1.**

### 10.2 Suricata IDS

- Runs on Pi3a (detection pillar), **IDS mode only** (alert generation; no inline blocking).  
- ET-Open / tuned local rules.  
- `eve.json` → aggregator → `ultron/suricata/#`.  
- IPS / inline enforcement = Phase 2 response design only.

---

## 11. Health Supervision

> **Phase 1 meaning:** service **liveness** — if a supervised unit is dead &gt;30s, restart it and log the incident. This is operational hygiene, not an autonomous remediation product.

### 11.1 Mechanism

- systemd `Restart=always` + `sentinel-heal` watchdog on Pi4.  
- Publish `ultron/health/{pi4,pi3a,pi3b}` every 10s.  
- Circuit breaker: after repeated failed restarts, pause 10 minutes and surface DEGRADED (prevents restart storms).

### 11.2 Out of scope (Phase 2+)

Configuration remediation playbooks, firewall edits, and autonomous containment remain **future response** work.

---

## 12. Alert & Reporting

### 12.1 Paths

| Path | Owner | When |
|------|-------|------|
| WebSocket push | Pi4 dashboard | every event ≤100ms |
| SMTP email | Pi3b alert manager | RED / PURPLE |
| LED/OLED | ESP32-C3 via Pi4 serial | every band/score |
| ACK | Dashboard → `ultron/ack/#` | operator |
| Daily Markdown | Pi3b report job | cron 00:05 |

### 12.2 Alert record

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "sev": "critical",
  "title": "Suricata: ET SCAN suspicious inbound",
  "src": "pi3a",
  "body": "...",
  "ts": "2027-03-01T10:30:00Z",
  "ack": false
}
```

### 12.3 Report skeleton

Daily file written to the **Pi4 USB3 pendrive vault** (synced from Pi3b): band timeline, top sources, new LAN devices, open vs acked alerts, node uptime.

---

## 13. Dashboard

> **No compromise.** Spec: [`dashboard.md`](dashboard.md).

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Delivery | One `index.html`, inline CSS/JS |
| Dependencies | **None** (no CDN, no build) |
| Latency | MQTT → pixel **&lt;100ms** |
| Port | Pi4 **:8080** |
| Features | Gauge, band theme, node grid, detection layers (IDS/LAN/WiFi/tripwire), alert feed + ACK, 24h chart, stats |
| States | LIVE / STALE / OFFLINE |

The dashboard is the **centerpiece of alert management** and the first thing a mentor sees.

---

## 14. ESP32 Physical Layer

### 14.1 ESP32-C3 — Indicator (USB → Pi4)

- WS2812B ring: band patterns (solid / chase / strobe / pulse)  
- SSD1306: score, band, last event, health dots  
- Serial JSON @10Hz: `{"score":42,"band":"YELLOW","nodes":4,"last":"..."}`  

### 14.2 ESP32-WROOM — Tripwire (GPIO)

- GPIO16 → Pi3a case, GPIO17 → Pi3b case (active-low, debounce 50ms)  
- **No buzzer** — band feedback is LED/OLED only  
- **No WiFi** — physically cannot be disarmed over the network  

### 14.3 Why physical feedback

Cloud dashboards fail when the network is degraded. LED/OLED keeps posture visible in the room — critical for a $290 offline story.

---

## 15. Operating Mode

### 15.1 ULTRON (sole mode)

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Sensing | Continuous (IDS, LAN, WiFi, tripwire) |
| Alerts | Full (dashboard, email, LED) |
| Governance | Always on |
| Manual tools | Operator override only — no autonomous active scan |
| Enforcement | **None** (Phase 2) |
| Stored at | `/etc/sentinel/mode` = `ULTRON` |

**Boot default:** Always ULTRON. There is no alternate mode or mode-switch MQTT command in this release.

---

## 16. MQTT Schema Reference

### 16.1 Envelope

|-------|-------|
| **Tool Name** | ULTRON — Smart-House IoT Cybersecurity Ecosystem |
| **Category** | **IoT** |
| **Repository** | https://github.com/ADITYA02NM/ULTRON |
| **Hardware** | 3× Raspberry Pi, 2× ESP32, ~$290 |
| **License** | MIT |

**Abstract (≈150 words):**  
ULTRON is a zero-cloud IoT security ecosystem for the smart house, built on three Raspberry Pis and two ESP32s (~$290). Phase 1 delivers lean detection (Suricata IDS, passive LAN new-device watch, passive WiFi, GPIO tripwires — no honeypots or active scanners), governance (weighted 0–100 risk score with GREEN/YELLOW/RED/PURPLE bands, decay, hysteresis), and alert management (sub-100ms single-file dashboard, SMTP on critical bands, LED/OLED physical indicators, acknowledgement and Markdown evidence). Nodes are pillar-isolated: Pi4 governance, Pi3a detection, Pi3b alert. The system runs autonomously offline in a single ULTRON mode for homes and small premises. Automated response and automated threat analysis/hunting are documented as future phases and intentionally not shipped in Phase 1. The demo shows an end-to-end detect → govern → alert loop visible on screen and in hardware.

**Audience takeaways:**

1. How to prioritize IoT alerts with a transparent risk score  
2. Pillar-isolated design on three cheap SBCs  
3. Physical (LED/OLED) feedback without cloud  
4. A demo-grade dashboard with zero dependencies  
5. A **lean sensor set** that proves you can guard a home without honeypot/scanner bloat
